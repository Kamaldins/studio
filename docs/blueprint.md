## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#DDE6ED) to evoke calmness and nature.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F8FAFC), almost white, for a clean, airy feel.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFB703) for a subtle warm highlight, drawing from sunset colors reflecting on lake Daugava. Note: I have replaced your primary HSL color from the prompt. Your scheme uses light backgrounds so the other colors you have chosen are too bright to create sufficient contrast with the background.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear and readable text.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) with Playfair for headlines and 'PT Sans' for body.
- Use clean, modern icons from Lucide React to represent amenities and features.
- Employ a responsive, mobile-first design with breakpoints at sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px, and 2xl: 1536px.
